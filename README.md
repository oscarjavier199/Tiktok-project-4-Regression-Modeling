## Overview

**The purpose** of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of EDA and build a logistic regression model and evaluate the model

*This project has three parts:*

**Part 1:** EDA & Checking Model Assumptions

**Part 2:** Model Building and Evaluation

**Part 3:** Interpreting Model Results

## Introduction
This is the fourth part out of 5 projects. The Final purpose of the projects is to develop a Machine Learning algorithm capable of classifying and predicting if a video posted by a TikTok user is either a 'claim' or an 'opinion', In this Project, we will build a logistic regression model in Python. Logistic regression helps estimate the probability of an outcome. For data science professionals, this is a useful skill because it allows us to consider more than one variable against the variable we are measuring against.

## Data Sources
The datasets used in this analysis include:
- **Tiktok Dataset:** Provided by Google as part of the 'Advanced Data Analytics and machine learning Professional Certificate'.
